# NTRUPRIME-pgplikescripts
NTRUPRME PGP-like scripts. Requires LIBOQS and python bindings for LIBOQS. Also needs an older LIBOQS that supports Streamlined NTRUPrime1277. 
Uses NTRUPrime and ECIES with Curve448 for key encapsulation. Turns Blake2b into a stream cipher just for fun. Shared libraries are here in case you don't feel like compiling and trust me :)
